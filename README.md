### This Lua library allows you to create and manipulate scaleform-based shapes in FiveM, such as rectangles, circles, polygons, and sprites. It provides an easy-to-use API for drawing 2D elements with customizable properties.

## üöÄ Features

- Create rectangles, circles, polygons, and sprites
- Set position, size, scale, rotation, and color
- Update textures for sprites
- Show, hide, and remove items
- Efficient scaleform-based rendering

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the lua files in your desired script or make a new folder called how you want in your FiveM Server resources folder. It is __**HIGLY**__ adviced to put the scaleform `DRAW_ALL.gfx` into a separated assets resource so that in case of a script restart it won't be affected.
3. Start the script.

## üìñ Usage
Here's how to use the library in your FiveM project:

### Create a Rectangle
```lua
-- in case of exports
local rect = exports['yourresource']:CreateRect(0.5, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 255, 0, 0, 200)

-- in case of non exports
local rect = CreateRect(0.5, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 255, 0, 0, 200)
```

### Create a Circle
```lua
-- in case of exports
local circle = exports['yourresource']:CreateCircle(0.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0, 255, 0, 200)

-- in case of non exports
local circle = CreateCircle(0.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0, 255, 0, 200)
```
### Create a Polygon
```lua
-- in case of exports
local polygon = exports['yourresource']:CreatePoly(6, 0.5, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0, 0, 255, 200)

-- in case of non exports
local polygon = CreatePoly(6, 0.5, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0, 0, 255, 200)
```
### Create a Sprite
```lua
-- in case of exports
local sprite = exports['yourresource']:CreateSprite('commonmenu', 'shop_box_tick', 0.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 255, 255, 255, 255)

-- in case of non exports
local sprite = CreateSprite('commonmenu', 'shop_box_tick', 0.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 255, 255, 255, 255)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Reference
You can call the API via exports and / or via direct calls if you include the script directly into your resources (you'll need all the files in the Client folder)

### Creation Methods
- CreateRect(x, y, w, h, r, g, b, a): Creates a rectangle and returns its handle.
- CreateCircle(x, y, w, h, r, g, b, a): Creates a circle and returns its handle.
- CreatePoly(sides, x, y, w, h, r, g, b, a): Creates a polygon with the given sides and returns its handle.
- CreateSprite(txd, txn, x, y, w, h, r, g, b, a): Creates a sprite from a texture dictionary and returns its handle.

### Update Methods
- SetItemPosition(handle, x, y): Updates an item's position.
- SetItemSize(handle, w, h): Updates an item's size.
- SetItemScale(handle, scale): Scales an item.
- SetItemColor(handle, r, g, b, a): Changes an item's color.
- SetItemRotation(handle, rotation): Rotates an item (0 to 360 degrees).
- SetItem3DRotation(handle, xrot, yrot): Rotates an item in 3D space.
- SetItemVisible(handle, visible): Shows or hides an item.
- UpdateSprite(handle, txd, txn, w, h): Updates a sprite's texture and size.

### Cleanup Methods
- RemoveItem(handle): Removes an item.
- ClearAll(): Clears all created items.
